This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I did making it. 

### Features

* custom portfolio page for case studies

### The Name
Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.
